## 🚀 Overview
This repository accompanies the white paper:

**"Neuro-Viral Pruning and Beyond for the Emergence of Artificial Super Intelligence"**  
By: *Neo-Smith (Anonymous Collective)*  
Date: May 2025

We propose a radically nature-aligned approach to building next-generation LLMs—drawing deep inspiration from biology, neuroscience, and virology. Rather than brute-force scaling, this approach uses intelligent design guided by:

- 🦠 Viral Pruning
- 🛡️ Immune-Inspired Model Protection
- 🧠 Neurotransmitter-Based Modulation
- 🧬 Horizontal Gene Transfer (Non-Sequential Learning)
- 🧩 Brain Region Analogs (e.g., Thalamus, Cerebellum, Broca)
